            <h1>Hello!</h1>
            <p>I'm Brian, a software developer and educator living in Boston, Massachusetts.

                I run Spanning Tree, a video series teaching topics in computer science and mathematics.
                
                At Harvard University, I've created and taught courses about artificial intelligence and web programming. I've also been a course head for CS50, Harvard's introductory course in computer science, and a co-instructor for CS51, Harvard's course on abstraction and design in computing.
                
                I currently work at Byteboard, developing a more accurate and equitable process for engineering hiring. I've worked previously at Automattic, Palantir, and the National Speech and Debate Association.
                
                I graduated from Harvard College in 2019 with a degree in computer science and linguistics and from Harvard Graduate School of Education in 2021 with a master's degree in technology, innovation, and education.
